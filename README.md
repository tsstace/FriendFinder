# :cherry_blossom: FriendFinder :cherry_blossom:

This full stack website will select your new best friend from a carefully curated list. The user will be prompted to submit a form with basic information and behavior-based questions. If all fields are filled in, a modal window will display the closest match from the friends json list. If there is an empty field, a modal window will prompt them to complete the data entry. 

All data values for the potential matches are stored in the friends-JSON array; a match is recommended based on the sum of the user's choices and the proximity to the friend's values.
